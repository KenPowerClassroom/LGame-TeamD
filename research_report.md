### What is the purpose of this document
The purpose of this document is to outline the important details of real world game we are recreating, our intended features and vision for where we want to take our game and everything needed in the game for it to be a functional product.

### Why are we doing this project
This group project, recreating “The L Game” in C++ in a team of 4-5, is a part of the Software Engineering Module in the Computer Games Development Bachelors degree in Carlow IT. 

What we hope to learn from this project:
-    Collaboration and GitHub merging
-    Dealing with GitHub merge errors
-    Implementation of clean, concise and well structured code that doesn’t only work well but also is easier to read and work with


## Game description

## Game rules
### Rule 1) setting up the board:
- Place the two neutral spaces on the bottom right-hand corner and the top left-hand corner. 
- One piece should be placed in an L shape right beside the neutral space on the bottom left. 
- The other player L piece should be “upside down and flipped” and beside the top left neutral space. 
- The pieces should form a rectangle in the middle of the board.

### Rule 2) movements for Players
- piece must stay inside the board, DON’T GO OFF BOARD for a new position.
- Don’t place L pieces on top of each other. 
- Each person has to wait their turn until other player is done. 
- When moving an L piece place it on a new 4 squares that makeup. 
- it must end in a different position from the position it started—thus covering at least one square it did not previously cover. 
- You can rotate or flip your L piece as long as it fits. 
- After your turn you can move one neutral piece and place it anywhere to block opponent.
